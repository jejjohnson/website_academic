## Bio

I am a CNRS post-Doctoral researcher at IGE/MEOM lab, where I am developing use cases for machine learning for computational and observation oceanography. My research has primarily applied machine learning in applications such as remote sensing, climate models, and observational oceanography. I usually work with large-scale spatial-temporal model simulations, reanalysis products or satellite observations with coordinate, grid-based or functional representations. I have an algorithmic background in manifold learning, kernel methods and information-theoretic measures. I specialize in (and typically apply) probabilistic models like Gaussian processes and generative models like Normalizing Flows, VAEs and Diffusion models.

I see myself as a facilitator (a.k.a. *Machine Learning Research Engineer*): I like to create conceptual frameworks to consolidate research into easy-to-understand ideas, and I would like to build software tools to help others accomplish their goals. I also consider myself a *Machine Learning Advocate*: I like being the liaison between ML and the applied sciences. My future endeavours are to continuously improve upon my ML engineering skills and start to get a grasp on the MLOPs field, and advocate modern ML practices in the geoscience setting. 

<!-- This includes good practices for: \
- data downloading and preprocessing strategies via recipes, e.g. Pangeo-Forge  \
- custom datasets and dataloaders, e.g. Torch-Geo \
- An ontology of models for different data representations, e.g. NerFs & Observations, CNNs/Neural Operators & Surrogates \ -->


This website will host a list of my current and past [projects](projects.qmd), [talks](talks.qmd), [conferences](conferences.qmd), and [publications](papers.qmd).
