# Research

These are the projects based on my academic research career, i.e. my Ph.D. and my current PostDoc.

## MeLODy | *Sept 2021 - Now*

Investingating how we can using machine learning in observation and computational oceanography. Specifically, we are working with geophysical observations obtained from satellite altimetry and we would like to constrain the solution with ocean models, e.g. NEMO, MITGCM. We approach this problem from a data assimilation formulation but with a machine learning perspective. Currently, we have broken this problem into 3 parts: 

1. Using Neural Fields to interpolate sparse, noisy sea surface height data from altimetry satellites (`nerf4ssh`)
2. Using conditional generative models to learn surrogate models (`cflow4surrgate`)
3. Using neural networks to solve 4DVar problems (`modern4dvar`)

In this project, I looked at various ways we could use machine learning to characterize uncertainty in geoscience applications. ML is useful but it is often not understood. However, we demonstrate that there are two aspects that would help alleviate the idea that ML is a "black-box": 1) error propagation and 2) sensitivity analysis.

## SAKAME 

**TLDR**: Investigating some connections between derivatives of kernel methods and standard sensitivity analysis in the physical sciences. 

We looked at how there is a connection between the derivatives of kernel methods and standard sensitivity analysis seen in the physical sciences. We looked at

## EGP 

**TLDR**: Investigating how we can do error propagation through Gaussian process regression model.

In this project I looked at how we can propagate input uncertainty through GP regression models. GPs are the gold standard for having well calibrated predictive mean and variances. However, there is not much (recent) research on how we can propagate input uncertainty. So we looked at how this was possible in the context of geoscience.

In this project, I looked at how we could use different machine learning methods to extract information from Earth System Data. We were given a massive amount of reanalysis data from various sources and we were interested to see how ML can be useful to extract information from said cubes. However, information theory is a difficult problem due to the curse of dimensionality which prohibits good density estimators that are necessary for said information theoretic metrics. We look at Gaussianization as a good density estimator with direct links to information theory due to the formulation.


:::{.callout-note appearance="simple" collapse="true"}

## Gauss4EO

**TLDR**: We give a empirical deep-dive into showing how Gaussianization is a good information theoretic estimator.

Gaussianization is a long standing density estimation method. In fact it is the first ever "normalizing flow" method within the literature. We look at a particular version which is called the Rotation-Based Iterative Gaussianization method. We demonstrate its usefulness in including 1) time-memory for drought indicators, 2) redundancy in hyperspectral images, 3) sampling for hyperspectral images, and 4) entropy for different spatial-temporal configurations.

## Gauss4IT

**TLDR**: We showcase how Gaussianization is a good density estimator and information theoretic estimator for various in Geoscience applications.

In this project, we take a deep-dive into the Gaussianization formulation and demonstrate empirically how it can be used to estimate information theoretic quantities like entropy, mutual information, multivariate mutual information and the Kullback-Leibler Divergence.

# Machine Learning "Sprints"

This are the projects that I was a part of for sprints; where I was a part of a multidisciplinary team looking to solve an applied problem using machine learning.

In this project, we were concerned with extracting lightning events from the GLM Lightning mapper. I was a part of a team that built an end-to-end machine learning pipeline that was able help do filter the point clouds and extract features that were indicative of lightning. We tried the standard techniques like PCA, some deep learning techniques like AutoEncoders, and finally some new SOTA like Graphical Neural Networks.

<!-- We implemented the following pipeline:

1. downloads light curves from telescope data
2. preprocesses the data
3. train a Gaussian process using MCMC methods to predict starspot properties
4. train a neural network model for predicting starspot properties -->

In this project, we were concerned with predicting spots on stars (as an indicator of star activity) from telescope data. I was a part of a team that built an end-to-end machine learning pipeline that was able help do just that. We were able to fit the data to get parameters using Bayesian inference. We were also able to use a neural network to predict star spot properties using transfer learning resulting in a x10K speed up!
